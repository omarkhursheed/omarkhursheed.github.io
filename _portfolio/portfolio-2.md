Implemented a CoGAN (coupled GAN) architecture to generate paintings combining genres from the WikiArt dataset. Coupled two GANs by weight sharing between initial and final layers of generators to produce combination of different genres being processed by each one. Used various forms of regularization to improve performance and stabilize training.
