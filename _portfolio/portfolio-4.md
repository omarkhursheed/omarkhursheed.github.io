title: "Human Activity Recognition with Machine Learning"
excerpt: "Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including SVMs, logistic regression, and CNNs for predicting future activities from the Extrasensory Dataset. Constructed a modified version of the dataset to meet the task definition by sampling and modifying the original semi-structured data cases to perform supervised learning.Performed dedicated data processing, developing a pipeline for missing data imputation and dimensionality reduction.
