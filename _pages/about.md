I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). I am interested in Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition and Machine Learning, and particularly in their applications to computational social science and the understanding of fictional narratives. I was advised by Professor [Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/), and have worked with Professor [Brendan O'Connor](http://brenocon.com/). 

<!-- I graduated in 2019 from Aligarh Muslim University, where I studied Computer Engineering, co-founded [AMU-OSS](https://amu-oss.github.io/), a club for open-source enthusiasts, and spent most of my free time at the University Debating and Literary Club, where I ran the performance poetry forum for two years. I was advised at AMU by Mr. [Asad Mohammed Khan](https://www.amu.ac.in/dshowfacultydata.jsp?did=30&eid=10059304) and Dr. [Rashid Ali](https://www.amu.ac.in/dshowfacultydata.jsp?did=30&eid=3011)

In my free time, I'm a literature enthusiast, and a fantasy fan in particular, diving deep into the epic worlds created by [Steven Erikson](https://malazan.fandom.com/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) and [Neil Gaiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)). A fantasy short story by me can be found [here](https://medium.com/@omarkhursheed/the-ashaar-a-short-fantasy-story-3816a6eab7bb).   -->
