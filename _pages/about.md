I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). I am interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Affective Computing. I am currently advised by [Professor Tauhidu Rahman](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/rahman-tauhidur) on a project mapping brain activity with emotion in children.
