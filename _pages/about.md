I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). I am interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Affective Computing. I am currently advised by [Professor Tauhidur Rahman](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/rahman-tauhidur). 

I graduated in 2019 from Aligarh Muslim University, where I studied Computer Engineering, co-founded [AMU-OSS](https://amu-oss.github.io/), a club for open-source enthusiast, and spent most of my free time at the University Debating and Literary Club, where I ran the performance poetry forum for two years. I was advised at AMU by [Mr. Asad Mohammed Khan](https://www.amu.ac.in/dshowfacultydata.jsp?did=30&eid=10059304) and [Dr. Rashid Ali](https://www.amu.ac.in/dshowfacultydata.jsp?did=30&eid=3011)

In my free time, I'm a literature enthusiast, and a fantasy fan in particular, diving deep into the epic worlds created by Steven Erikson and Neil Gaiman.
