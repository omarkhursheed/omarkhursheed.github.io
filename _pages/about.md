I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working on machine learning and speech recognition. My research focuses on developing efficient deep learning architectures for real-world applications, particularly in keyword spotting and wake word detection. I'm passionate about making ML systems more efficient and equitable.

At Amazon, I've led projects that improved wake word detection accuracy across diverse user demographics and pioneered new techniques for resource-constrained environments. My work has been published at leading conferences including ICASSP, INTERSPEECH, and EMNLP.

Previously, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, where I worked on natural language processing and multimodal machine learning. I also hold a B.Tech. in Computer Engineering from Aligarh Muslim University.
