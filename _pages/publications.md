## 2023
**Small Footprint Slimmable Networks for Keyword Spotting**  
Akhtar Z, **Khursheed MO**, Du D, Liu Y  
*IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)*  
Developed dynamically slimmable transformer architectures enabling parallel training of different sized keyword spotting networks (40 different-sized transformers trained in 3.72x the time of one).

## 2022
**Latency Control for Keyword Spotting**  
Jose C, Wang J, Strimel GP, **Khursheed MO**, Mishchenko Y, Kulis B  
*INTERSPEECH*  
Introduced novel method for balancing latency-accuracy tradeoffs, reducing false accepts by 24% while maintaining baseline latency.

## 2021
**Tiny-CRNN: Streaming Wakeword Detection in a Low Footprint Setting**  
**Khursheed MO**, Jose C, Kumar R, Fu G, Kulis B, Cheekatmalla SK  
*IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU)*  
Developed self-attention augmented model combining convolutional and recurrent components, reducing false accepts by 25% with 10% lower parameter count.

## 2020
**Analyzing Gender Bias within Narrative Tropes**  
Gala D, **Khursheed MO** (co-first author), Lerner H, OConnor B, Iyyer M  
*Workshop on NLP and Computational Social Science, EMNLP*  
Created novel methodologies for analyzing gender bias through large-scale dataset construction.
